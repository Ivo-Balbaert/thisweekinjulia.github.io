This is a simple blog to keep track of major changes to the [Julia language](http://julialang.org) and ecosystem.  I've been interested in keeping up with the development of the julia master branch, but things move fast! As someone who has limited time to follow the issues and mailing lists, I think this blog has the potential to be very useful.  

Help me keep it up to date!  See a new big breaking change get merged into master?  Add it to the running post for the next week!  I'm not sure how well this is going to work, but it's worth a shot.  Check it out on [GitHub](https://github.com/thisweekinjulia/thisweekinjulia.github.io) - pull requests very welcome!
